soPypilla
---------

Trying to write a library to query some Chile's dbs
like nombrerutyfirma, volanteomaleta, etc. All by
using selenium and webscrapping with beautifulsoup.

For now there's a sample script named sopypa.py with
a basic query, it returns a dictionary which contains
all gathered information.


soPypilla is in its first version, I will be updating
the project over time if I have the opportunity since
I'm busy with other things.

SUPPORT: Python 3.6+



TODO
----

-> Add headless browser (PhantomJS)
-> Add 'volanteomaleta' query class
-> Add LookUp class (Interact with user and its vehicle info)
-> Add sopypa tool (stalker tool)
-> Replace README with fancy markdown
-> eat tacobell
